# Alternative control for aws or cloud servers

## About the project
🚧 **Project is under development** 🚧

[Preview](https://cloud-front.gdpro.com.br/)

This project is an alternative way to control aws machines and cloud platforms, generate more advanced reports and have more internal control over the machines.


AWS, for example, has an [API - ec2/describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) that provides the instances.
